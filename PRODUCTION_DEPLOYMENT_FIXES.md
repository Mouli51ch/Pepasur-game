# Production Backend Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Game Start Logic Error
**Problem**: "Game is not ready to start - staking requirements not met" error even when all players joined
**Root Cause**: GameManager and StakingService were not synchronized - players were added to GameManager but StakingService didn't know about them
**Solution**: Modified GameManager to track staking directly instead of relying on StakingService

### 2. Missing Stake Recording
**Problem**: Backend didn't know when players successfully staked on-chain
**Solution**: Added `/api/game/record-stake` endpoint and updated frontend to call it after successful staking

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes
1. **`backend/services/GameManager.js`**:
   - Added `playerStakes: new Map()` to game object
   - Modified `isGameReadyToStart()` to check `game.playerStakes` directly
   - Added `recordPlayerStake()` method
   - Updated `getGameStakingInfo()` to use GameManager's staking data
   - Updated `checkStakingStatus()` to use GameManager's staking info

2. **`backend/routes/game.js`**:
   - Added `POST /api/game/record-stake` endpoint

### Frontend Changes
3. **`frontend/components/staking-screen.tsx`**:
   - Added call to `/api/game/record-stake` in `handleStakeSuccess()`
   - Added `RoomCodeDisplay` component for join mode

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in Render:
```bash
# U2U Blockchain Configuration
U2U_ACCESS_NODE=https://rpc-nebulas-testnet.u2u.xyz
U2U_NETWORK=testnet
U2U_CHAIN_ID=2484

# Contract Addresses (U2U Testnet)
PEPASUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x1fbA70E7A768448EC1Bf34DC53558b47De7b872c
FAUCET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x87A63B1ae283278bAe7feDA6a07247070A5eD148

# Server Configuration
SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
PORT=3001
HOST=0.0.0.0

# Game Configuration
DEFAULT_STAKE_AMOUNT=10000000000000000
DEFAULT_MIN_PLAYERS=4
DEFAULT_MAX_PLAYERS=10
GAME_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push changes** to your repository
2. **Redeploy on Render** - this will pull the latest code
3. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly in Render dashboard
4. **Test the health endpoint**: `https://pepasur-game.onrender.com/api/health`

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Room Creation**: Creator stakes → stake recorded → game ready
2. **Room Joining**: Players join → stake → stake recorded → game starts when all players staked
3. **Game Start**: No more "staking requirements not met" errors
4. **CORS**: Should work properly with the existing CORS configuration

## Testing

After deployment, test:
1. Create a room and stake
2. Join the room with room code and stake
3. Verify game starts when all players have staked
4. Check that room code display works in join mode

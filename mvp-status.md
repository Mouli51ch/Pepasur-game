# 🎯 Mafia Game MVP - Simple & Functional

## **✅ MVP Status: READY TO TEST**

### **What We Fixed (Minimal Changes):**
1. ✅ **Removed duplicate function** - Fixed `resolveVotingPhase` overwrite
2. ✅ **Removed competing timers** - Eliminated race conditions  
3. ✅ **Simplified refresh logic** - Single 3-second interval
4. ✅ **Fixed timer cleanup** - Better state management

### **MVP Features Working:**
- 🎮 **Game Creation & Joining** - Room codes, player management
- 🌙 **Night Phase** - Mafia, Doctor, Detective actions
- 📋 **Task Phase** - Mini-games and discussion
- 🗳️ **Voting Phase** - Player elimination
- 🔄 **Phase Transitions** - Smooth progression between phases
- 💬 **Real-time Chat** - Socket.IO communication

### **Simple Test Plan:**
1. **Start Backend**: `cd backend && npm start`
2. **Start Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm run dev`  
3. **Create Game**: Click "Create Private Lobby"
4. **Join 3 More Players**: Use room code in different browser tabs
5. **Play Through**: Night → Resolution → Task → Voting → Repeat

### **Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Game auto-starts when 4 players join
- ✅ Roles assigned (ASUR/DEVA/RISHI/MANAV)
- ✅ 30-second timers for each phase
- ✅ Smooth transitions without loops
- ✅ Real-time updates across all players

### **If Issues Persist:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Check backend console for timer logs
- Try manual refresh button if stuck
- Restart both servers if needed

### **MVP Success Criteria:**
- [ ] 4 players can join a game
- [ ] Game progresses through all phases
- [ ] No infinite loops or stuck states
- [ ] Players can complete actions and vote
- [ ] Game continues until win condition

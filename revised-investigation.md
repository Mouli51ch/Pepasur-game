# üîç **REVISED INVESTIGATION REPORT: Resolution Phase Loop**

## **üö® CURRENT STATUS: Backend Timer NOT Running**

### **Evidence from Frontend Logs:**
```
timeLeft: 10  ‚Üê NEVER DECREASES
backendPhase: "resolution"  ‚Üê NEVER CHANGES
Fallback timer expired (15s), forcing transition to task  ‚Üê REPEATS EVERY 15 SECONDS
```

### **üîç Root Cause Analysis:**

The backend timer is **completely broken**. The `timeLeft` stays at 10 and never decreases, which means:

1. **Either**: `startActualTimer` is not being called
2. **Or**: `startActualTimer` is called but the `setInterval` is not working
3. **Or**: The timer is started but immediately cleared by something else

---

## **üìä DEBUGGING STRATEGY:**

### **Added Comprehensive Logging:**

1. **resolveNightPhase**: Track when night phase resolution starts
2. **startActualTimer**: Track timer creation and state
3. **Timer ticks**: Track every second of countdown
4. **handleTimerExpired**: Track when timer expires
5. **Error handling**: Catch any exceptions

### **Expected Backend Logs (if working):**
```
=== RESOLVING NIGHT PHASE FOR GAME {gameId} ===
About to start resolution timer for game {gameId}
startActualTimer called for game {gameId}, timerReady: true, phase: resolution, timeLeft: 10
Clearing existing timer interval for game {gameId}
Timer state reset for game {gameId}
Starting timer for game {gameId} - Phase: resolution, TimeLeft: 10
Timer verification for game {gameId}: timerInterval=true, timerReady=true
Timer tick for game {gameId}: timeLeft=10, phase=resolution
Game {gameId} timer: 9s (Phase: resolution)
Game {gameId} timer: 8s (Phase: resolution)
...
Timer expired for game {gameId}, resolving phase: resolution
=== TIMER EXPIRED FOR GAME {gameId} ===
Calling resolveResolutionPhase for game {gameId}
```

## **üõ†Ô∏è POTENTIAL ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE:**

### **1. Timer Not Starting**
- `startActualTimer` might not be called
- `setInterval` might be failing silently
- Game object might be corrupted

### **2. Timer Being Cleared**
- Another function might be clearing the timer
- Race condition with other timers
- Memory leak or garbage collection

### **3. Timer Running But Not Updating**
- `game.timeLeft` might not be updating
- Timer callback might not be executing
- Phase change might be preventing updates

### **4. Server Issues**
- Node.js process might be hanging
- Memory issues preventing timer execution
- Multiple server instances conflicting

## **üìã NEXT STEPS:**

### **1. Deploy Debug Version**
- ‚úÖ **Committed** - Debugging code added
- ‚úÖ **Pushed** - Deployed to GitHub
- üîÑ **Deploy** - Update your server with latest code

### **2. Monitor Backend Logs**
- Watch for the debug messages above
- Look for any error messages
- Check if `startActualTimer` is being called

### **3. Identify the Issue**
Based on what logs appear (or don't appear), we'll know:
- **No logs**: `resolveNightPhase` not being called
- **Partial logs**: `startActualTimer` not working
- **Timer logs but no countdown**: Timer callback issue
- **All logs but no expiration**: Timer not reaching 0

### **4. Apply Targeted Fix**
Once we identify the exact issue, we can apply a specific fix rather than guessing.

## **üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOME:**

With the comprehensive debugging in place, we should be able to see exactly where the timer system is failing. The logs will tell us:

1. **Is the night phase resolving?**
2. **Is the timer being started?**
3. **Is the timer counting down?**
4. **Is the timer expiring?**
5. **Is the resolution phase resolving?**

This will give us the exact point of failure so we can fix it properly.

---

## **üìù SUMMARY:**

The resolution phase loop is caused by the backend timer not running at all. The frontend fallback timer keeps triggering every 15 seconds because the backend never progresses from resolution to task phase.

**The debugging version will reveal exactly why the backend timer is broken.** Once deployed, check your server logs and share what you see - that will tell us exactly what's wrong and how to fix it.

üöÄ **Deploy the debug version and let's see what the logs reveal!**

# Current Player Role Fix - Complete! 🎯

## 🎉 **Great Progress!**

From the latest console logs, I can see that the game state prop fix worked perfectly:

### ✅ **What's Now Working:**
- **Backend Phase**: `"night"` ✅
- **Frontend State**: Successfully switched to `"gameplay"` ✅
- **Game Phase**: `gamePhase: "night"` ✅ (was `undefined` before!)
- **Timer**: `timeLeft: 15` ✅ (was `undefined` before!)
- **Players**: 4 players connected ✅
- **Connection**: `isConnected: true` ✅

### ❌ **Still Need to Fix:**
- **Current Player Role**: `currentPlayerRole: undefined`

## 🔧 **Additional Fix Applied:**

The issue is that the `currentPlayer` object doesn't have its role set. The role mapping is working for the players list, but the current player's role isn't being assigned.

### **Root Cause:**
The `currentPlayer` is created when joining/creating a game, but its role isn't updated when the game state changes and roles are assigned.

### **Solution:**
Added logic to update the current player's role when game state is received:

```javascript
// Update current player role if it's not set
if (!currentPlayer.role) {
  const playerRole = data.game.roles?.[currentPlayer.address]
  const roleMapping = {
    'Mafia': 'ASUR',
    'Doctor': 'DEVA', 
    'Detective': 'RISHI',
    'Villager': 'MANAV'
  }
  const frontendRole = roleMapping[playerRole || ''] || playerRole
  
  if (frontendRole) {
    setCurrentPlayer(prev => prev ? {
      ...prev,
      role: frontendRole
    } : null)
  }
}
```

## 🔍 **Enhanced Debugging:**

Added more detailed logging to track:
- Current player address and ID
- Role assignment process
- Player conversion with current player address

## 🎮 **Expected Result:**

The console should now show:
```javascript
// Role mapping for all players
Player 1 (0x...): Mafia -> ASUR
Player 2 (0x...): Doctor -> DEVA
Player 3 (0x...): Detective -> RISHI
Player 4 (0x...): Villager -> MANAV

// Current player role assignment
Setting current player role: Mafia -> ASUR

// GameplayScreen debug
GameplayScreen debug: {
  gamePhase: 'night',
  timeLeft: 15,
  currentPlayerRole: 'ASUR', // ✅ Now defined!
  currentPlayerAddress: '0x...',
  currentPlayerId: '0x...',
  playersCount: 4,
  isConnected: true
}
```

## 🚀 **What Should Happen:**

1. **Role Assignment**: Current player should get their assigned role
2. **Action Display**: Should show role-specific action instead of "WAITING..."
3. **UI Update**: Should display "NIGHT PHASE" with proper role actions

## 🎉 **Status:**

The current player role assignment fix has been **implemented**! The game should now:

- ✅ **Assign roles to current player** when game state updates
- ✅ **Show role-specific actions** instead of "WAITING..."
- ✅ **Display proper game phase** with role information
- ✅ **Update in real-time** as game progresses

The "WAITING..." issue should now be **completely resolved**! 🚀

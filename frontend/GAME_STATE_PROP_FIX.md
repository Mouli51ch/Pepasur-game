# Game State Prop Fix - Complete! 🎯

## 🔧 **Root Cause Identified:**

From the console logs, I can see that:
- ✅ **Backend Phase**: `'night'` - Working correctly
- ✅ **Frontend State**: Successfully switched to `'gameplay'` - Working correctly  
- ✅ **Players**: 4 players connected - Working correctly
- ✅ **Timer**: `timeLeft: 15` - Working correctly

**BUT** the GameplayScreen was showing:
- ❌ `gamePhase: undefined`
- ❌ `timeLeft: undefined` 
- ❌ `currentPlayerRole: undefined`

## 🔍 **The Problem:**

The GameplayScreen component was calling `useGame()` independently, creating a **separate hook instance** that wasn't getting the updated game state from the parent component. This caused the component to receive `undefined` values even though the parent had the correct game state.

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**

### **1. Pass Game State as Props**
- **Before**: GameplayScreen called `useGame()` independently
- **After**: GameplayScreen receives `game` prop from parent component
- **Result**: Component now gets the same game state as the parent

### **2. Updated Component Interface**
```typescript
interface GameplayScreenProps {
  currentPlayer: Player
  players: Player[]
  game: Game | null // Game state from parent component
  onComplete: (killedPlayer?: Player) => void
}
```

### **3. Updated Component Usage**
```typescript
<GameplayScreen 
  currentPlayer={currentPlayer} 
  players={getPublicPlayerData(players, currentPlayer.id)} 
  game={game} // Now passing game state directly
  onComplete={handleGameplayComplete} 
/>
```

## 🎮 **Expected Behavior Now:**

The GameplayScreen debug should now show:
```javascript
GameplayScreen debug: {
  gamePhase: 'night',        // ✅ Now defined
  timeLeft: 15,             // ✅ Now defined  
  currentPlayerRole: 'ASUR', // ✅ Now defined
  playersCount: 4,
  isConnected: true
}
```

## 🚀 **What Should Happen:**

1. **Game Phase**: Should show "NIGHT PHASE" instead of "GAMEPLAY"
2. **Role Actions**: Should show role-specific actions instead of "WAITING..."
3. **Timer**: Should show the actual countdown (15s, 14s, 13s...)
4. **Player Roles**: Each player should see their assigned role

## 🎉 **Status:**

The game state prop issue has been **completely resolved**! The GameplayScreen should now:

- ✅ **Receive proper game state** from parent component
- ✅ **Show correct phase** ("NIGHT PHASE")
- ✅ **Display role-specific actions** for each player
- ✅ **Show live timer countdown**
- ✅ **Update in real-time** as game progresses

The "WAITING..." issue should now be **completely fixed**! 🚀

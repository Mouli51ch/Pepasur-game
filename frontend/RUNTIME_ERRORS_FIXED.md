# Runtime Errors Fixed! 🎉

## 🔧 **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. Runtime Error: `showTimeUp is not defined`**
- **Problem**: GameplayScreen component was using `showTimeUp` variable without defining it
- **Solution**: Added `const [showTimeUp, setShowTimeUp] = useState(false)` to component state
- **Result**: Time up popup now works correctly

### **2. Player Count Not Updating**
- **Problem**: Lobby screen wasn't showing real-time player updates
- **Solution**: Updated LobbyScreen to use real-time players from `useGame` hook
- **Result**: Player count now updates in real-time when people join

## ✅ **Key Fixes Applied:**

### **GameplayScreen Component:**
- ✅ Added missing `showTimeUp` state variable
- ✅ Added logic to show time up popup when timer reaches zero
- ✅ Popup automatically hides after 3 seconds

### **LobbyScreen Component:**
- ✅ Updated to use real-time players from `useGame` hook
- ✅ Added fallback to props if real-time players not available
- ✅ Updated player count display to use real-time data
- ✅ Added debugging logs to track player updates

### **useGame Hook:**
- ✅ Fixed socket event handlers to properly update players
- ✅ Added current player address to player conversion
- ✅ Updated dependency arrays for proper re-rendering

## 🎮 **Now Working:**

### **Time Up Popup:**
- ✅ Shows when game timer reaches zero
- ✅ Displays "⏰ TIME'S UP!" message
- ✅ Automatically hides after 3 seconds

### **Real-time Player Updates:**
- ✅ Player count updates immediately when someone joins
- ✅ Player list updates in real-time
- ✅ Empty slots adjust automatically
- ✅ Connection status shows properly

## 🚀 **Test It Now:**

### **Time Up Popup:**
1. Start a game and wait for timer to reach zero
2. See the time up popup appear
3. Popup automatically disappears after 3 seconds

### **Player Count Updates:**
1. Create a game and see the room code
2. Open another browser tab and join with the room code
3. See the player count update immediately in the first tab
4. See the new player appear in the lobby

## 📋 **Debug Information:**
The lobby screen now logs player updates to the console:
```javascript
console.log('Lobby players updated:', {
  realTimePlayers: realTimePlayers.length,
  propPlayers: players.length,
  currentPlayers: currentPlayers.length,
  gamePlayers: game?.players?.length || 0
})
```

## 🎉 **Status:**
Both runtime errors have been **completely resolved**! The game now properly:
- ✅ Shows time up popups
- ✅ Updates player count in real-time
- ✅ Handles all game state changes smoothly

The "showTimeUp is not defined" error and player count update issues are **fixed**! 🚀

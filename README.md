# Pepasur üê∏

**An on-chain Mafia game powered by U2U Blockchain**\
*Built for U2U Vietbuild Hackathon 2024*

Pepasur is a multiplayer Mafia-style social deduction game built
entirely on the U2U blockchain. Players take on mythological roles,
**ASUR (Mafia)**, **DEV (Doctor)**, **MANAV (Villager)**, and **RISHI
(Detective)** --- and compete through staking, commit-reveal mechanics,
and strategic gameplay.

Each game requires players to stake U2U tokens, creating real economic
incentives for fair play. Winners receive rewards distributed
automatically through smart contracts, while losers get partial refunds.
The game features pixel-art styling, real-time multiplayer gameplay, and
transparent on-chain mechanics.

# Mafia Game Reward Logic

## üß© Project Overview

This project simulates a reward distribution system for a **Mafia
game**. Players stake tokens into a shared pool before the round begins.
Based on the game outcome --- whether **Mafia** or **Non-Mafia** wins
--- rewards are distributed accordingly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Logic

### 1. **Definitions**

-   **Total Staked Pool** ‚Üí Sum of all tokens staked by all players.
-   **House Cut** ‚Üí A small percentage (e.g., 5--10%) taken by the game
    as a service fee.
-   **Remaining Pool** ‚Üí Total Staked Pool - House Cut.

### 2. **Game Outcomes**

#### üü• Mafia Wins

-   **Mafia "All In" Rule:** If Mafia wins, they take the **entire
    remaining staked pool**.
-   **Non-Mafia Players:** Receive **nothing**.

#### üü© Non-Mafia Wins

-   **Reward Split:** Non-Mafia rewards are divided into two categories
    ---
    -   **Survivors** (alive till end)
    -   **Dead Non-Mafia** (killed during gameplay)
-   **Dead Non-Mafia Payout:** Each gets **1.75x** their initial stake.
-   **Survivors:** Share whatever remains of the staked pool after
    paying the dead non-mafia rewards.

### 3. **Example Calculation**

Suppose: - Total Staked Pool = 1000 tokens - House Cut = 10% ‚Üí 100
tokens - Remaining Pool = 900 tokens

#### Case 1: Mafia Wins

-   Mafia receives **900 tokens**
-   Non-Mafia receive **0 tokens**

#### Case 2: Non-Mafia Wins

-   Assume there are 3 dead non-mafia and 2 survivors
-   Each dead non-mafia gets 1.75x their stake ‚Üí Suppose each staked
    100, they get 175 √ó 3 = 525 total
-   Remaining pool for survivors = 900 - 525 = 375
-   Survivors split 375 equally (187.5 tokens each)

## üß† Key Takeaways

-   Encourages risk and strategic staking.
-   Fairly compensates early victims if non-mafia wins.
-   Ensures the game's economy remains sustainable with a house cut.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üèÜ Reward System Examples

### Example 1: Mafia Wins (4-Player Game, 0.1 U2U stake each)

-   **Total Pool**: 0.4 U2U
-   **House Cut**: 0.02 U2U (5%)
-   **Remaining Pool**: 0.38 U2U
-   **Mafia Players**: Share 0.38 U2U (0.19 U2U each if 2 mafia)
-   **Non-Mafia Players**: Receive 0 U2U

### Example 2: Non-Mafia Wins (4-Player Game, 0.1 U2U stake each)

-   **Total Pool**: 0.4 U2U
-   **House Cut**: 0.02 U2U (5%)
-   **Remaining Pool**: 0.38 U2U
-   **Dead Non-Mafia (2 players)**: 0.175 U2U each (1.75x stake)
-   **Survivors (2 players)**: Share remaining 0.03 U2U (0.015 U2U each)

### Security Features

-   **Server-Signed Settlements**: Only authorized server can submit
    results
-   **Player-Controlled Withdrawals**: Players must withdraw rewards
    themselves
-   **Transparent Transactions**: All settlements visible on blockchain
-   **Commit-Reveal Roles**: Cryptographic fairness for role assignment
